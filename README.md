### L'Oreal Datathon 2025

Problem Statement 1: CommentSense

For this problem statement, participants are required to measure content effectiveness through Share of Engagement (SoE) metrics such as likes, comments, saves and shares, but the main focus will be on comments. 

Question is simple: what do the comments on a particular video tell us about the content itself? How does the comments correlate with the effectiveness of the content? 


The main deliverables of this task will be:
Prototype that analyses the quality + relevance of comments at scale, and shows how these comments are able to measure content effectiveness.
This prototype should take in all comments > classifies, scores and summarise them into comments of Quality vs Low-Value vs Spam, Positive vs Neutral vs Negative,
categorise them into specific categories, determine whether or not a comment is relevant to the video. 

A key feature of the prototype should include the ability to produce a ratio of "quality" comment > based on a KPI (to be invented by participants) that measures all the features mentioned above and determine if the comment is of high quality or not.
